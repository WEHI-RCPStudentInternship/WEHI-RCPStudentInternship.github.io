## Expectations
Before you apply - please ensure you can take the time to spend doing at least 6 to 8 hours per week on these internships:
- 1 hour a week for a project meeting with your supervisor and your teammates, 
- 1 hour a week for a co-working session with your teammates,
- 1 hour a week keeping track of emails and organising yourself, and
- the rest working on projects in your own time and asking 10+ questions a week at standups that run twice a day but are not mandatory

Also please ensure you:
- ask 10+ questions a week about your project,
- email a group weekly report before your meeting each week,
- 4 touch points per week with your supervisor (project meeting, weekly group email summary, and two other interactions)
- keep an Individual Learning Plan (ILP) and a technical diary,
- keep on top of the emails sent about your internship (there are a lot!),
- keep an up to date calendar so you can plan your week, and
- let your supervisor by email if you are unable to work on the internship.

## Key Questions you should answer in the cover letter

We suggest that you write a 1 page cover letter introducing yourself. 

We would want you to answer:
- Are you applying for course-credit or are you applying as a volunteer?
- What project are you applying for? The [list of projects curently available is here](https://wehi-researchcomputing.github.io/project-wikis).
- How can you demonstrate that you will be organised, communicate well and ask questions in this internship?

We also have [material on how to write a good cover letter and what to look for when you are writing a resume](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21057535.v2).

Please provide a single pdf with cover letter and resume. One way to merge them is to [use an online pdf merging tool like this one](https://www.ilovepdf.com/merge_pdf).

Due to the volume of students now applying to this internship, to be eligible you must fill out the RCP Student Internship Enrollment form.
