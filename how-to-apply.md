# How to Apply

We have three intakes per year - Semester 1 (March to May), Semester 2 (August to October), and Summer (November to February the next year). The [intake dates currently available and hours per week are here](intake_dates).

Please provide a resume and cover letter.

- 1 hour a week for a project meeting with your supervisor and your teammates, 
- 1 hour a week for a co-working session with your teammates,
- 1 hour a week keeping track of emails and organising yourself, and
- the rest working on projects in your own time and asking 10+ questions a week at standups that run twice a day but are not mandatory

Also please ensure you:
- ask 10 questions a week about your project,
- email a group weekly report before your meeting each week,
- keep an Individual Learning Plan (ILP) and a technical diary,
- keep on top of the emails sent about your internship (there are a lot!),
- keep an up to date calendar so you can plan your week, and
- let your supervisor by email if you are unable to work on the internship.
