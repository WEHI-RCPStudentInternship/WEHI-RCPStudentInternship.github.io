# Process Improvement Engineer (Forecasting Budgets)
## Introduction

Administrators across teams often handle numerous spreadsheets from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERPs) each year. These spreadsheets contain vital data for budget forecasting, but the process of doing the analysis may not be uniform across the organisation, especially when the information is frequently updated and subject to change.

The ERP Budget Forecasting project aims to enhance the efficiency of downloading and analysing ERP data to improve budget forecasting accuracy while minimising human error.

ERPs are set up to be generic and so different departments have worked independently on streamlining the forecasting of budgets. WEHI would like to look at these departments and see if there is a consistent approach that could be implemented or software that could systematise an approach.

Discussions on how to improve processes and what is a consistent approach will need to be turned into requirements and verified with interested parties. This will be managed by the supervisor although the successful interns will be expected to ask questions and contribute.

This project will seek to develop a proof of concept that streamlines the processes of data creation, updates, and finalisation for budget forecasting. The goal is to maximise flexibility and minimise the potential for human error that could output an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis.

To integrate seamlessly into the existing infrastructure, the initial concept involves creating a user-friendly application that can read in an ERP spreadsheet, allowing users to efficiently create, update, and finalise budget forecasts in a consistent approach. 

## Duties while on Placement
The role of the Process Engineer Intern will include:
- Collaborating with subject matter experts to identify their current process regarding budget forecasting.
- Reviewing and discussing ways to improve the process and identify consistent approaches that could be streamlined.
- Reviewing available options for building a proof-of-concept application based on discussion of consistent approaches, focusing on maintainability and extensibility.
- This project offers flexibility, allowing the intern to contribute their own ideas and introduce new features and functionalities.

## General Expectations of interns
- 1 hour a week for a project meeting with your supervisor and your teammates,
- 1 hour a week for a co-working session with your teammates,
- 1 hour a week keeping track of emails and organising yourself, and
- the rest working on projects in your own time and asking 10+ questions a week at standups that run twice a day but are not mandatory
- email a group weekly report before your meeting each week,
- keep an Individual Learning Plan (ILP) and a technical diary,
- keep on top of the emails sent about your internship (there are a lot!),
- keep an up to date calendar so you can plan your week, and
- let your supervisor by email if you are unable to work on the internship.

## Benefits for students 

Basic knowledge or a willingness to learn R/Shiny, JavaScript, CSS, databases, and Linux command-line.
Ability to quickly grasp high-level concepts and apply them effectively.
- Capacity to work independently while also collaborating with the team to discuss theories and results.
- Strong analytical skills to interpret data accurately.
- Familiarity with version control systems like Git would be advantageous.
