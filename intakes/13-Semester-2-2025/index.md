# REDMANE Demo
The objective of my internship was to **revive and modernize REDMANE**, a modular Research Data Management (RDM) platform designed to help researchers securely manage, organize, and share biomedical datasets. The aim was to restore its functionality, improve stability, and prepare the system for future scalability and integration.

What I did was focus on **rebuilding the system infrastructure** by setting up and configuring the cloud environment, containers, and network layers to ensure stable communication across services. I worked on **migrating the database system** and successfully **connected the database to the backend**, improving backend functionality and deployment reliability. I also streamlined the setup process and created **comprehensive technical documentation** to support future maintenance and development.

How far I got was a **nearly complete system**, with the backend and database fully connected and running smoothly, and the final step being to establish the connection between the backend and frontend. This progress laid the groundwork for completing the full data flow and advancing REDMANE toward a production-ready stage.
